                    Goddess Lakshmi is the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune,
                    power, beauty, fertility, and prosperity. She is the wife
                    and active energy (shakti) of Lord Vishnu, the supreme being
                    of preservation. Her four hands represent the four goals of
                    human life considered important to the Hindu way of life:
                    dharma (righteousness), kama (desires), artha (wealth), and
                    moksha (liberation from the cycle of birth and death).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lakshmi is depicted as a beautiful woman of golden
                    complexion, with four hands, sitting or standing on a lotus
                    flower, dressed in fine garments and precious jewels. Her
                    four hands represent the four goals of human life considered
                    important to the Hindu way of life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Hindu mythology, Lakshmi was born from the
                    churning of the cosmic ocean of milk (Samudra Manthan) by
                    the devas (gods) and asuras (demons). She chose Vishnu as
                    her eternal consort and accompanies him in all his
                    incarnations.

                    The most important festival dedicated to Lakshmi is Diwali,
                    the Festival of Lights. On this auspicious night, homes are

                    welcome Lakshmi. It is believed that Lakshmi visits the

                    part of Diwali preparations.
