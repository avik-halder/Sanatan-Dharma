                  <p>
                    Lord Brahma is one of the principal deities of Hinduism and
                    a member of the Trimurti (the Hindu Trinity) along with
                    Vishnu and Shiva. Brahma is revered as the creator of the
                    universe and all beings within it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Hindu mythology, Brahma emerged from a golden
                    egg (Hiranyagarbha) or from the navel of Lord Vishnu on a
                    lotus flower. He is traditionally depicted with four faces,
                    symbolizing the four Vedas (sacred texts), and four arms,
                    holding various items including a scepter, a book of
                    knowledge (the Vedas), a water pot (kamandalu), and prayer
                    beads (mala).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite his significant role in creation, Brahma is not as
                    widely worshipped as Vishnu or Shiva in contemporary
                    Hinduism. There are relatively few temples dedicated solely
                    to Brahma, with the most famous being the Brahma Temple in
                    Pushkar, Rajasthan, India.

                    One popular myth explains why Brahma is not widely
                    worshipped. It is said that Brahma once lied to Shiva,
                    claiming he had found the end of a cosmic pillar of light
                    (which was actually Shiva himself in the form of a lingam).
                    As punishment for his falsehood, Shiva decreed that Brahma
                    would not be widely worshipped on earth.

                    Goddess Saraswati is considered the consort of Brahma. She
                    is the goddess of knowledge, music, arts, wisdom, and
                    learning, complementing Brahma's role as the creator of
