                    Lord Hanuman, also known as Anjaneya, Maruti, Pawanputra,
                    and by many other names, is one of the most beloved and
                    worshipped deities in Hinduism. He is revered for his
                    unwavering devotion to Lord Rama, incredible physical
                    strength, profound wisdom, and selfless service.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Depicted as a monkey with a human-like body, Hanuman is
                    considered an avatar (incarnation) of Lord Shiva. He is the
                    son of Anjana and Kesari, with the wind-god Vayu playing a
                    role in his birth, thus giving him the name Pawanputra (son
                    of the wind).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hanuman's most significant role appears in the Hindu epic
                    Ramayana, where he serves as Lord Rama's ardent devotee and
                    helps in the rescue of Rama's wife Sita from the demon king
                    Ravana. His extraordinary feats during this mission,
                    including leaping across the ocean to Lanka, finding Sita,
                    and later bringing an entire mountain with life-saving
                    herbs, showcase his divine abilities and unwavering
                    dedication.
