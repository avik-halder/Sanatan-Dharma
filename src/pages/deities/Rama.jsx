                    Lord Rama (also known as Ramachandra) is the seventh avatar
                    of Lord Vishnu and one of the most widely worshipped deities
                    in Hinduism. He is revered as the embodiment of dharma
                    (righteousness), the ideal son, husband, brother, and king.
                    His life story, narrated in the epic Ramayana, serves as a
                    moral and spiritual guide for Hindus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Born to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya of Ayodhya,
                    Rama's life was marked by adherence to truth, duty, and
                    sacrifice. When his father, bound by a promise to his wife
                    Kaikeyi, had to exile Rama to the forest for fourteen years,
                    Rama accepted the decision without resentment, demonstrating
                    his unwavering commitment to filial duty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During his exile, Rama's wife Sita was abducted by the demon
                    king Ravana. This led to an epic battle in which Rama, with
                    the help of his devoted companion Hanuman and an army of
                    monkeys and bears, defeated Ravana and rescued Sita. This
                    victory symbolizes the triumph of good over evil. After
                    completing his exile, Rama returned to Ayodhya and was
                    crowned king. His reign, known as "Ram Rajya," is considered
                    the epitome of good governance and is often invoked as an
                    ideal state of society where justice, peace, and prosperity
                    prevail.
